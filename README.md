# Welcome to Story Path App

I used GenAI specifically ChatGPT and ClaudeAI. 

I used ChatGPT mostly to generate docstrings and comments. I also used ChatGPT to help with styling and creating all style sections. 

For errors and challenges I had in my code, I asked ChatGPT and ClaudeAI to help me understand error codes and messages and find the root of the problems. When I could not figure something out I would ask them to look over my code and see what might be causing errors. I also asked them to help refine my code and see where I could make things more concise.
